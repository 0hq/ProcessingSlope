# Slope + Desert Bus = Processing Slope

To play the game, download the currently non-existent .exe or .dmg file or load the .pde in Processing.























# Roadmap:

### Version 1
Ball is rendered with some rolling animation.  
Ball rolls down a hill and hits a wall and stops.  
No background.  
No score  
Physics.  

### Version 2
Ball is rendered.  
Speed Platforms.  
Score is rendered.  
Death blocks and walls.  
(THIS WOULD BE THE CURRENT STATE OF SLOPE WITHOUT BACKGROUND AND VANITY ELEMENTS)  

### Version 3
Expand playing horizon horizontally  
Biomes as alternate regions  
Coins that add score  
Powerups would be interesting  

### Version 4
Skinning  
Background  
Ball movement and parallax 

# Questions and Suggestion

### How will speed increase work? Will it increase or reach a stable point?  
How about it reaching a point where it slowly increases?  
Maybe if we always steadily increase but provide many opportunities to slow down?  
I'm looking at something like 10x^0.5 where the rate of increase slows down but not asymptotically.
